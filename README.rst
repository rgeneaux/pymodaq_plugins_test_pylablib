PyMoDAQ generic plugins meant to be subclassed for quick implementation of cameras using the pylablib library.
List of cameras that can be interfaced using this class: `pylablib documentation <https://pylablib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/cameras_root.html>`_

**Important:** this is for development purposes only, the plugin will not work on its own.

Viewer2D
++++++++

* **GenericPylablibCamera**: Generic plugin for a camera, handling hardware ROI, hardware binning, grabbing frames using a callback, switching between 1D and 2D depending on data shape, and optional framerate display.
The class needs to be subclassed in order to define two simple ``list_cameras`` and ``init_controller`` methods, which depend on the actual camera.
